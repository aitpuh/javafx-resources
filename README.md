This repo is here to:
1. Group all of our tutorials into one project that you can clone and work on.
2. Give you a blank IdeaProject to begin working immediately. 

There will be a few folders here where you can find the following:
1. JavaFX Project walkthroughs
2. Git setup and workflow guide
3. Database setup and connection guides
4. Whatever else we decide might be useful to you.


Hope you enjoy!
